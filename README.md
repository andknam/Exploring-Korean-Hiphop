# Exploring Korean Hiphop Music!
Inspired by https://hiphopology.xyz, this respository contains a genius lyrics scraper that extracts artist verses from songs (meaning lyrics in choruses, bridges, hooks, etc. are ignored). Verse lyrics are separated by language into English, Korean, and Korean-English (English words with trailing Korean characters). 

**In the works:**
- Writing the scraping results to a csv file
- NLP analysis performed separately on the English and Korean lyrics (Korean-English will be ignored for the time being)
- Statistics such as unique word percentage, verses per album, words per verse, English vs Korean usage

**Things in consideration:**
- Korean word clouds, song topic analysis, statistic for most used adlib, English and Korean verse line syntax trees
- Website to showcase all results and statistics
