# Exploring Korean Hiphop Music!
Inspired by https://hiphopology.xyz, this respository contains a genius lyrics scraper that extracts artist verses from songs (meaning lyrics in choruses, bridges, hooks, etc. are ignored). Verse lyrics are separated by language into English, Korean, and English-Korean (English words with trailing Korean characters). 

**In the works:**
- [x] (added 5/24/2020) Writing the scraping results to a csv file 
- [ ] NLP analysis performed separately on the English and Korean lyrics (English-Korean will be ignored for the time being)
- [x] (added 6/6/2020) Basic album statistics and token statistics

**Things in consideration:**
- [x] (4 added thru 6/6/2020) Korean word clouds
- [ ] song topic analysis, statistic for most used adlib, English and Korean verse line syntax trees
- [ ] Website to showcase all results and statistics
